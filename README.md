## Introduction

Shopee is a leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. It is a platform used by many people in Malaysia because of its wide variation of products avaiable.

As the number of products increase, the UI/UX is getting more complex and too much unesscary elements in it in my opinion. So this clone will try to focus on simplicity which I believe could lead into more conversions for new users as well as to practice and showcase my understanding of Vue.

## Features

- Much simpler UI
- The web app feels much faster as it is a SPA

## Packages

- VueJs 3
- TailWind CSS
- Vue Router 4
- Vuex
